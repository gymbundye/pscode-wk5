// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

Variables Would be Num1 and Num2 and NumSum (what those two numbers equal)

so the function would be something like

Add2numbers {    
    Num1+Num2  == NumSum 
                    } 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

The variable would be Num (the number we are checking)  
To check if a number is even or odd we can see if it
is divisible by two. If so it is. If we divide and there is a remainder we
know its not.

so the function would be something like

Checkeven{
    if Num/2==%0
     Num is Even
    else Num is Odd 
}



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)

The Variables here would be
 Num1 Num2 Num3 Num4 Num5
and what they add up To
NumSum
and what they are divided by 5
NumAvg

To fund the average of the 5 numbers we would add them and divide by 5

so the function for that is something like
  User Inputs 5 Numbers

NumAvg{
    Num1+Num2+Num3+Num4+Num5=NumSum
    NumSum/5
}
return "The Average of the 5 numbers is {NumAvg}"

One way we could check to see which number is the Samllest  and the Largest is to
compare the value of each against eachother of with  else/if staments so the
function would look like this for the maximum

if { Num1>Num2&&Num1>Num3&&Num1>Num4&&Num1>Num5
     return({Num1} is the largest number!)
     }
  else  if { Num2>Num1&&Num2>Num3&&Num2>Num4&&Num2>Num5
         return({Num2} is the largest Number!)
  } 
   else  if { Num3>Num1&&Num3>Num2&&Num3>Num4&&Num3>Num5
         return({Num3} is the largest Number!)
  } 
  else  if { Num4>Num1&&Num4>Num2&&Num4>Num3&&Num4>Num5
         return({Num4} is the largest Number!)
  } 
  else  if { Num5>Num1&&Num5>Num2&&Num5>Num3&&Num5>Num4
         return({Num5} is the largest Number!)
  } 

And this for the minimum

if { Num1<Num2&&Num1<Num3&&Num1<Num4&&Num1<Num5
     return({Num1} is the smallest number!)
     }
  else  if { Num2<Num1&&Num2<Num3&&Num2<Num4&&Num2<Num5
         return({Num2} is the smallest Number!)
  } 
   else  if { Num3<Num1&&Num3<Num2&&Num3<Num4&&Num3<Num5
         return({Num3} is the smallest Number!)
  } 
  else  if { Num4<Num1&&Num4<Num2&&Num4<Num3&&Num4<Num5
         return({Num4} is the smallest Number!)
  } 
  else  if { Num5<Num1&&Num5<Num2&&Num5<Num3&&Num5<Num4
         return({Num5} is the smallest  Number!)
  }
