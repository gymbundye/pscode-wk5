// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(Your pseudocode here)

Variables Would be Num1 and Num2

so the function would be

Add2numbers {    
    Num1+Num2   
                    } 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

The variable would be Num (the number we are checking)  
To check if a number is even or odd we can see if it
is divisible by two. If so it is. If we divide and there is a remainder we
know its not.

so the function would be

Checkeven{\\\
}


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
